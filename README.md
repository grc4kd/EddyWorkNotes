# README

## Prerequisites
- This application requires a Postgres database server to store and retreive persistent data for users.
  - This project assumes a postgres server instance is configured at `localhost`. 
- The postgres database connection can be changed for a development build in runtime app settings, under the directory `ui\appsettings.json`.
- An easy way to manage app secrets outside of `appsettings.json` is to use the `dotnet user-secrets` utility. The 
app expects a database connection string to configured with the key `ConnectionStrings:EddyWorkNotesContext`. A
configured user secret at the project level has been tested and overrides the configuration from `appsettings.json`.

## Running the application
The application can be started as normal, with `dotnet run` or `dotnet run --project ui` depending on the working
directory. You can also use the debuggers of Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code to start the app with full support.
Unit tests are available to run with `dotnet test` or the IDE unit test explorer tools, respectively. The `ui` app
is all that has to run for the interactive server to come online. It handles data object-relational database mapping
through EF Core, an asynchronous timer interface written in Blazor and JavaScript, and a basic report view using the
built-in QuickGrid component.

## Project Structure
There are additional C# projects that support the `ui` project, managed with a solution file in the top-level directory.

These projects are as follows:
- `app` The backend services that host background functions and timers outside of the Blazor / web client context.
- `DataEntities` A project for mappings from the database layer to the application layer, handled by EF Core using 
metadata from C# record types and property attribute annotations, such as:
    ```csharp
    [property: JsonPropertyName("description")] 
    public string? Description { get; set; } = Description;
    ```
    This Description class member is a field assigned during the record's class constructor. It stores string data and
    maps to the property name "description" in lower-case when serialized or deserialized from another .NET type. 
    Finally, this data type is publically accessible through the member accessor `WorkNote.Description`. You can get and
    set the value like any regular C# object property from other classes.

- `PlaywrightTests` This was created using the .NET library for Playwright automated UI testing. I've used it so far to
implement basic smoke testing through a web browser client during `dotnet test`.

- `test` This project contains unit and integration tests written in Xunit during project development. The goal for
coverage is to test anything beneath the UI layer here that depends on project / client code. All of these tests should 
be run continuously through the development process and, therefore, they should be very lightweight and speedy.

And of course, you can read even more documentation inside of the [docs](./docs/) folder, but this wraps up the
high-level overview.
