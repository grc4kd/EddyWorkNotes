# For a Programmer engaged with Coding

These instructions outline how to use Eddy during your typical workflow. For the following examples, assume we are using Eddy to track your individual progress on a coding project. 

1. Starting a New Task/Session
    1. Record Initial Mood: Before you begin coding, open Eddy and record your current mood score (e.g., 0.6 for slightly unmotivated). This provides a baseline.
    2. Define Skill Focus: Identify the primary skill you'll be working on (e.g., "Python Debugging").
    3. Set Initial Goal: Set a target level for that skill (e.g., 0.8). Eddy will track your progress towards this.
2. During Coding
    1. Skill Assessment: As you encounter challenges, periodically (e.g., every hour or after completing a significant feature) record a skill assessment for the skill you're focusing on. Be honest! A score of 0.7 might indicate you're making progress but still encountering difficulties.
    2. Mood Tracking: Briefly update your mood score if it changes significantly. A frustrating bug might lower it, while a successful implementation could raise it.  
3. Requesting Feedback
    1. Trigger Feedback Request: After completing a module or feature, use Eddy to request feedback on the skills you've been working on (e.g., "Python Debugging", "Code Readability").
    2. Specify Feedback Areas: If you have specific areas you'd like feedback on (e.g., "Error handling in the authentication module"), include that in your request.
4. Receiving and Processing Feedback:
    1. Record Feedback: When you receive feedback (from a peer review, mentor, or self-assessment), record it in Eddy. Include the rating and comments.
    2. Update Current Metrics: Eddy will automatically update your current skill metrics based on the feedback.
    3. Review Adjusted Metrics: Examine the adjusted metrics to identify areas for improvement.  
5. Iterating and Improving:
	1. Review Improvement Recommendations: Eddy will provide recommendations based on your metrics (e.g., "Focus on unit testing to improve code reliability").
    2. Set New Goals: Adjust your skill goals based on the recommendations and your progress.
    3. Repeat: Continue this cycle of assessment, feedback, and improvement to enhance your skills and maintain a positive flow state.
# Example Scenario: 
1. Start  
	- [ ] Mood: 0.6, Skill: "Python Debugging", Goal: 0.8
2. Coding (2 hours)  
	- [ ] Skill Assessment: 0.7 (encountering some tricky bugs)
3. Request Feedback  
	- [ ] Request feedback on "Python Debugging" - specifically error handling.
	
4. **(later on, after peer review)** Receive Feedback
	- [ ] Peer review rates error handling as 3/5 with comments: "Good overall, but could use more descriptive error messages." 
5. Eddy Updates
	- [ ] Skill metric for "Python Debugging" updated to 0.75. Recommendation: "Improve error message clarity."
6. Next Session
	- [ ] Focus on writing more descriptive error messages.

These instructions are a starting point. As you become more familiar with Eddy, you can customize your workflow to suit your individual needs and preferences.
