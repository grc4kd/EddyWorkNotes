# Overview

## Documentation Review

### 1. [Chapter 1: Eddy - A Project Management Personal (Virtual) Assistant](./chapter_1.md)
**Purpose**: This document introduces Eddy as a project management tool designed to help users maintain focus and productivity by leveraging automation and cognitive science principles, particularly the concept of flow state.

**Key Function Points**:
1. **Flow State Engine**: 
   - Calculates flow potential based on skill level, challenge level, and feedback quality.
   - Returns flow potential score (0-1) and emotional state (e.g., "Engaged", "Boredom").
2. **Algorithm Components**:
   - Skill Level: Numerical representation of user proficiency.
   - Challenge Level: Activity difficulty rating.
   - Feedback Quality: Clarity and immediacy of feedback (0-1).
3. **Flow State Calculation**:
   - If skill level and challenge level mismatch by >3, returns "Boredom" or "Anxiety".
   - Adjusts flow potential based on feedback quality.
4. **Emotional State Mapping**:
   - Maps flow potential to emotional states: "Focused", "Interested", or "Engaged".

#### 2. [Chapter 2: Skill Level Analysis](./chapter_2.md)
**Purpose**: This document details Eddy's skill level analysis component, which evaluates user proficiency in specific skills and provides quantified skill levels.

**Key Function Points**:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gathers raw data from sources like tests and projects.
2. **Data Normalization**:
   - Converts metrics to a consistent scale (0-1).
3. **Skill Level Calculation**:
   - Calculates weighted average of accuracy (70%) and speed (30%).
4. **Level Assignment**:
   - Maps scores to skill levels: Novice (<0.5), Intermediate (0.5-0.8), Advanced (>0.8).

#### 3. [Usage for Programmer Engaged with Coding](./usage_programmer_coding.md)
**Purpose**: This document provides practical instructions for programmers using Eddy during their coding workflow.

**Key Function Points**:
1. **Task Initialization**:
   - Record initial mood and define skill focus.
2. **Skill Assessment**:
   - Periodically record self-assessments of skill proficiency.
3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Request feedback on specific skills or code areas.
4. **Improvement Cycle**:
   - Update metrics based on feedback.
   - Receive improvement recommendations.

#### 4. [Summary](./SUMMARY.md)
**Purpose**: Provides a table of contents for the documentation set, linking to key sections.

**Key Function Points**:
- Links to main sections: Eddy overview, skill level analysis, and usage guidelines.

---

#### 5. [Diagrams](./diagrams.md)
**Purpose**: Contains Mermaid diagrams that visualize the flow state engine logic.

**Key Function Points**:
1. **Flow State Decision Tree**:
   - Visual representation of how skill level, challenge level, and feedback quality determine flow potential.
2. **Emotional State Mapping**:
   - Shows how different conditions lead to specific emotional states.
