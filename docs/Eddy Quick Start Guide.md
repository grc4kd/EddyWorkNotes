Eddy helps you track your skill development and maintain motivation while coding. Here's how to get started:

**1. Starting a New Task:**

* **Record Initial Work Notes:**  Log anything you need to get started. For example, I like to include things like:
  * Names, URLs, and metadata for systems involved with a new process. This doesn't normally include fine details or software architecture concerns, but is more about the servers and networks involved in the current problem.
  * Details required to replicate bugs and issues in development. Steps that reproduce the bug. A general but useful description of where to find the bug and what output to test to confirm it.
  * How much time I expect to spend on the problem. The type of problems I hope to track with this software should be
  broken down into achievable, time-bound tasks. I tend to spend around 30 minutes to 2 hours on any given problem.
  Some problems take longer than others.

**Essentially:** Track your work, get feedback, and use that feedback to improve and set new goals.
